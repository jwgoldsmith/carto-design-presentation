## Cartographic Designer Presentation for The Wilderness Society

[Cartographic Designer](http://jwgoldsmith.github.io/carto-design-presentation) is a presentation aimed at showing the GIS, Communications, and IT teams at The Wilderness Society the capabilities of my work experience, and how I'm learning new technologies and tools for (print and web) map-products. The presentation is created with the intention to be used in perpituity, either in a custom-reveal.js developer environment, or with [Slides] (http://slid.es).

## Nuts and Bolts

### Presentation Framework

The deck uses [Hakim El Hattab](http://twitter.com/hakimel)'s wonderful [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).

### Screenshots

Screenshots are taken using Apple OS X's Grab utility after setting window size with [Irradiated Software's
SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/). SizeUp's _Center_ shortcut is set to use an absolute size of
`1024w 704h`.

Web screenshots use Chrome after disabling _View âž­ Always Show Bookmark Bar_, then applying SizeUp.

TIF files saved from Grab are added to the `images` directory following a loose naming convention of
`ApplicationName-Action-Detail.tiff`. TIF files are generally resized to `768w 528h` at `72 pixels/inch` and saved to
the `images` directory as non-interlaced PNGs. Both the unaltered TIF and sized PNG are committed to the repository.
